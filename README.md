Local AI Assistant for IT Operations: Deploying a Self-Hosted LLM with Secure System Integration

This is a personal project meant to showcase my skills as an IT/Cybersecurity professional I will be building a self-hosted LLM trained and promp tuned to assist in sysadmin tasks inlcuding but not limited to PowerShell scripting and log parsing. More specifically I want this LLM to be able to: Parse and answer IT-related questions (e.g., “What PowerShell command resets a user password?”), generate or review scripts for system tasks, safely query local system information, and be accessed securely via a local web interface or CLI.

Features:

-Local LLM deployment providing AI assitance with no internet connection required
-Integration with system utilities
-CLI & web based interface allowing interaction from terminal or browser
-Custom prompt tuning and training to specialize in IT use cases

Technology Stack:

-Ollama (LLM Backend)
-Docker Desktop (Containerization)
-Python (Scripting)
-Fast API (API Layer framework)
-Gradio (Web UI)

System Requirements:

-Windows 11
-RAM: 16 GB minimum (32 GB recommended)
-GPU: 8 GB VRAM (preferably higher)
-Disk Space: ~10-30 GB for models & cache
